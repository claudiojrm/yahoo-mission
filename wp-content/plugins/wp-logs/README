WP-Logs
Custom event logging for Wordpress developers.
Google Analytics code adapted from there4 development.

To install, copy the plugin files to your Wordpress plugins directory and activate it in the admin area. Then add the following line to your scripts:

$EventLog = new EventLog(array(
	'event' => 'Login Successful',
	'text' => var_export($_REQUEST,1),
	'user_id' => $user_id
));

The only required parameter is 'event' and you can supply any value you'd like for text.

To have your events posted to Google Analytics, add your UA code to line 25 of analytics_events.php. If you are using Yoast's Google Analytics plugin, you can skip this step.
